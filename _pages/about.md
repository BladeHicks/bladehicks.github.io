üëã Hi there! **I am a researcher, artist, and pizzaiolo leveraging the comptuer as a medium for creative expression.** I recently graduated with a BA in Music from [Berea College](https://www.berea.edu/ target='_blank'). <a href="https://www.berea.edu/" target="_blank">Berea College2</a>. While there, I held a work-study position as a Student Craft Weaver where I had the opportunity to make [quilts](https://www.bcloghousecrafts.com/student-craft-garden-sampler-quilted-tapestry.html), [textiles](https://www.bcloghousecrafts.com/student-craft/weaving/), and a jacket! I also participated in a student research project with my peers to program, construct, and present on [ThanatoFenestra](https://isam2022.hemi-makers.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/119..pdf) -- a techno-family altar that functions from a candle flame. My udergraduate experience concluded with a presentation surveying the history of computer music for my Senior Capstone.

üçï Presently, my days are spent slinging Detroit and Neapolitan style pizzas from my home oven.<br>
ü§ñ By night I expand my artistic practice enganging text-to-audio sound design with [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).
