üëã Hi there! **I am a researcher, artist, and pizzaiolo leveraging the comptuer as a medium for creative expression.** I recently graduated with a BA in Music from Berea College. While there, I held a work-study position as a Student Craft Weaver where I had the opportunity to make [quilts](https://www.bcloghousecrafts.com/student-craft-garden-sampler-quilted-tapestry.html), [textiles](https://www.bcloghousecrafts.com/student-craft/weaving/), and a jacket! I also particapted in a student research project with my peers to program, construct, and present on [ThanatoFenestra](https://isam2022.hemi-makers.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/119..pdf). A digital-physical altar that functions from a candle flame. My udergraduate experience concluded with a presentation surveying the history of computer music for my Senior Capstone. 

üçï Presently, I spend my days slinging Detroit and Neapolitan style pizzas from my little home oven. 

ü§ñ By night I expand my artistic practice by uncovering the mysteries of text to audio programming with [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).
