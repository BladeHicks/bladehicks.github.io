👋 Hi there! **I am a researcher, artist, and pizzaiolo leveraging the comptuer as a medium for creative expression.** I recently graduated with a BA in Music from <a href="https://www.berea.edu/" target="_blank">Berea College</a>. While there, I held a work-study position as a Student Craft Weaver where I had the opportunity to make <a href="https://www.bcloghousecrafts.com/student-craft-garden-sampler-quilted-tapestry.html" target="_blank">quilts</a>, <a href="https://www.bcloghousecrafts.com/student-craft/weaving/" target="_blank">textiles</a>, and a jacket! I also participated in a student research project with my peers to program, construct, and present on <a href="https://isam2022.hemi-makers.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/119..pdf" target="_blank">ThanatoFenestra</a> -- a techno-family altar that functions from a candle flame. My udergraduate experience concluded with a presentation surveying the history of computer music for my Senior Capstone.

🍕 Presently, my days are spent slinging Detroit and Neapolitan style pizzas from my home oven.<br>
🤖 By night I expand my artistic practice enganging text-to-audio sound design with <a href="https://supercollider.github.io/" target="_blank">SuperCollider</a>.
