Hi there! I am a researcher and artist exploring the crossroads of computers and creative expression. I recently graduated with a BA in Music from Berea College. While there, I held a work-study position as Student Craft Weaver where I had the opportunity to make [quilts](https://www.bcloghousecrafts.com/student-craft-garden-sampler-quilted-tapestry.html), [textiles](https://www.bcloghousecrafts.com/student-craft/weaving/), and a jacket! I also particapted in a student research project where my peers and I programmed, constructed, and presented on [ThanatoFenestra](https://isam2022.hemi-makers.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/119..pdf). A digital-physical altar that functions from a candle flame. I rounded out my college experience with a presentation surveying the history of computer music for my Senior Capstone. I now spend my days slinging Detroit and Neapolitan pizzas from my little home oven, and my nights are spent uncovering text to audio programming with Supercollider.
