**ThanatoFenestra is a digital altar that combines computer and sensor technology with cultural practices around grief to provide a space of solace that is both accessible and culturally sensitive.** This student-led replicative study brought to life the design concept originally concieved by media-designer and professor <a href="https://daisuke.uriu.jp/about/?lang=en" target="_blank">Dr. Daisuke Uriu</a>.  

**Dates**: June - August 2022.  
**Participants**: Nancy Landeros, Ndizeye Tschesquis, and Blade Hicks.  
**Tools**: Raspberry Pi3, Python, OpenCV, lasercutter, AutoDesk Inventor, eletronic sensors.  
**URL**: <a href="https://github.com/cheskynd/TFURCPP.git" target="_blank">https://github.com/cheskynd/TFURCPP.git</a>  

**My role** included designing and constructing a portable altar that could accommodate a pico projector, mirror, raspberry pi3, and a circuit board with light and temprature sensors. I also wrote a program for image manipulation utilizing the OpenCV (python) libray. Additionally, I handled daily documentation, wrote the two page abstract, managed conference entry and logistics, and designed a poster.

**Background and Replication Objective**  
ThanatoFenestra is a Japanese Buddhist altar reimagined into a circular frame which displays a projected image that is manipulated by a candle flame. The concept addresses space challenges of urban living by miniaturizing a traditional Butsudan altar. Zen Buddhist ideals inspired the circular shape of the structure, which understands the circle as a window into the afterlife. A circular wooden frame with Japanese paper is attached to the rear that acts as the projector screen. From the front, a wooden shelf is nestled below the frame's center. The shelf’s purpose is two-fold: it suspends the incense bowl above a tea candle and it hides the sensors that will read the candle flame’s condition. The original concept used a PC laptop, projector, and a custom microcontroller hidden outside the frame. Our goal was to recreate the design with open-source and off-the-shelf components, and fully enclose all electronics for a single portable artifact.

**Presentation**  
This project allowed us the opportunity to present a poster at the <a href="https://isam2022.hemi-makers.org/" target="_blank">International Symposium on Academic Makerspaces, 2022</a>.<br>
