**BraillePhone is a conceptual braille-based smartphone and tablet.** The design takes insperation from a dear friend whose favorite passtime is to read books on their phone and tablet. However, they live in fear that their visual impairment may one day regress into blindness and take from them their favorite activity. BraillePhone seeks to reduce this fear and empower individuals living with visual imparment by accomodating the joys and pleasures of reading and connectivity.

**Tools**: Autodesk Inventor.
